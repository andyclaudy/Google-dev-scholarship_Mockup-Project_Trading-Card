# Google-dev-scholarship_Mockup-Project_Trading-Card
## Animal trading cards

This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program hosted by Udacity in colaboration with Google. Below you can find the description and requirements of the project.

## Project Submission
Use what you've learned about CSS to convert a design prototype into a functional webpage!

Once you're satisfied with your result, check your project against the Project Rubric to make sure you've satisfied all requirements.
Create a zip file containing card.html, styles.css, and your new animal image (unless you linked to an image hosted online).
Submit your project to be reviewed.
Have fun and be creative 🐠 🐍 🐅 🐼 🐫 ! Writing CSS isn't an exact science, so feel free to experiment. For example, you might want to add rounded corners or a background color to your card. Your submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as you satisfy all the requirements.

## CRITERIA

* Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
* Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).
